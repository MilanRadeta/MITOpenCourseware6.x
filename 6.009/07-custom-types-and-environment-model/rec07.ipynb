    "## Object-Oriented Design: War Card Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's design a card game. If you've never played War before (or if you have), \n",
    "here's the variant of the game that we will play. The\n",
    "deck is split evenly between two players. On each turn, both players\n",
    "reveal their first cards. The player showing the card with the highest rank takes both\n",
    "cards and adds them to his or her deck and reshuffles his or her hand. If there is a tie, the players\n",
    "reveal their next cards. If there is no longer a tie, the player with\n",
    "the highest rank takes all four cards on the revealed stack into their hand (and reshuffles their hand). \n",
    "Otherwise, both players continue revealing their next cards until the tie is broken. \n",
    "The game continues until one player has collected all 52 cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "What classes and methods do we need? Each card has a rank and a suit,\n",
    "so it makes sense to make a **Card** class with these attributes. In our\n",
    "game, \"greater\" cards are those with higher rank; cards with the same\n",
    "rank are \"equal\", no matter what suit they come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Hand** is a collection of Cards, so we'll make that another class. We can give\n",
    "and take cards from a Hand and also shuffle the cards in a Hand. We'll\n",
    "want to know how many Cards are in a Hand, so we'll need a `num_cards` method,\n",
    "among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Deck** is a special kind of Hand, populated with (in our case) the \n",
    "standard 52 cards. We can `deal` cards from a Deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Player** is also a Hand of cards, but with a (person) name also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the **Game** class implements all of the game logic. This class\n",
    "implements methods for dealing hands, taking a turn, and playing a\n",
    "game to determine a winner."
