<ul>
<li>
<p>Although the quiz is being given remotely, you will still be expected to follow all of
the rules and policies outlined below, including
no interactions with other people as you work the quiz and resubmission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should work the quiz at a (hopefully quiet and low-distraction)
location of your choosing and with Internet access.  At the time
allocated for your quiz, your quiz page will become available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to confirm that you are assigned to the correct quiz
session (start and end time), before the quiz we will ask that you <strong>go to
<a href="https://py.mit.edu/fall20/quizzes/quiz1/quiz">the quiz page</a>
in advance of the quiz to confirm  your quiz time.</strong>
The page should read: "This page is not yet available. It will become available on
October 14, 2020 at 07:35:00 PM" (times reported on that page are in the Eastern time zone).</p>
<p>Or, if you have been confirmed for <strong><a href="https://py.mit.edu/fall20/quizzes/quiz1/conflict">the conflict or accommodation
quiz</a></strong>,
the page should should indicate the start time that has been
arranged for your quiz. Please contact us if your quiz start time is not
correct, or if you have not yet reached out about a conflict/accommodation
that you need.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_2"></a><a class="anchor" name="_quiz_coverage"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">2) Quiz Coverage<a class="cs_permalink" href="#_quiz_coverage">§</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The quiz covers material from lectures/tutorials/labs in weeks 0
through 5, including Labs 0 through 5 (inclusive).</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_3"></a><a class="anchor" name="_quiz_mechanics"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">3) Quiz Mechanics<a class="cs_permalink" href="#_quiz_mechanics">§</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The quiz mechanics are similar to those for a lab.  At the start
of the quiz session, you will download a zip file with the necessary
files, including tests.  You will have 110 minutes to finish
your coding and submit your <code>quiz.py</code> file online using the upload
box on the quiz page.  As with labs, you can submit multiple
times. Only your <strong>last</strong> quiz submission will be graded.
Note that submissions will be disabled at the end of your
quiz session, so please submit before the end of the session. Once
the system indicates your submission is queued for testing, you're
all set; you don't have to wait for the tests to complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will need a computer to work on the quiz.  Please make sure
that your computer can hold a charge for the duration of the exam, or
that you have an outlet and charger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quiz assumes you have Python 3.6 (or a later version) installed
on your machine.  It is your responsibility to ensure that Python and the
appropriate tools for editing code have been installed and tested before
the start of your session.  You will also need to be able to log into the
6.009 server in order to download the .zip
archive containing the quiz files and to upload your <code>quiz.py</code> to be
scored.</p>
<p>The practice quizzes below can serve as a good test for your setup, as they
are presented in the same format that the quiz will use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are allowed to access online materials, including search engines,
forums, and the Python documentation, but <strong>we do not expect these resources
to be particularly helpful</strong>, so it is likely in your interest not to spend too
much time searching them.  Additionally, your code submission <em>should not
include any code that you did not write yourself</em>, and you should <em>cite</em> any
sources you referenced during the quiz.  You may include code you previously
wrote yourself, without attribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, <strong><font color="red">it is against the collaboration policy
to discuss the exam with anyone</font> -- even after you complete
the quiz and/or complete any resubmission -- until resubmissions
have been completed for all students and final quiz scores
assigned, because many students will still be working on resubmissions
or other/conflict offerings of the quiz.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_4"></a><a class="anchor" name="_testing_and_questions_during_the_quiz"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">4) Testing and Questions During the Quiz<a class="cs_permalink" href="#_testing_and_questions_during_the_quiz">§</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As in the labs, <code>test.py</code> can be used to test your code.
Each of the problems will have a set of test cases.
Remember that you can run specific problems' test cases like so:</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">  python3 test.py problem1
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>For your own debugging, you are welcome to add test cases of your own
to <code>test.py</code> (but note that any tests you add will not be run on the
server). You may also write as many helper functions as you want in
<code>quiz.py</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that Python's built-in <code>help</code> function will provide a concise
summary of built-in operations on data types (e.g., <code>help(set)</code>) or
information about the arguments for the built-in functions (e.g.,
<code>help(sorted)</code>). These will generally be sufficient for quick
help; however, you are also allowed to access the
<a href="https://py.mit.edu/_static/fall20/library.pdf"><code>library.pdf</code></a> file, which contains Chapters
1-5 of the Python 3.8 Library Reference, including Chap. 2 on built-in
functions and Chap. 4 on built-in data types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have questions during the quiz, please use <a href="https://py.mit.edu/fall20/queue">the help queue</a> to ask for help.
Note that while we can answer administrative
questions and clarify specifications of coding problems, we cannot
provide coding help.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_5"></a><a class="anchor" name="_grading"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">5) Grading<a class="cs_permalink" href="#_grading">§</a></h2>
<p>Quiz1 is worth 10% of the overall grade in 6.009, as outlined on the
<a href="https://py.mit.edu/fall20/information#_overall_grade_and_grade_components">information page</a>.
Your raw score on the exam will ultimately translate to an equivalent grade for
the quiz per the published 6.009 grading policy.  Your quiz score will be based
primarily on test cases passed by your last-submitted file during the quiz,
plus partial credit as determined by a human grader.  Therefore, consider
including incomplete solutions, pseudocode, or even just detailed comments in
English, even if one of your functions passes no tests.</p>
<p>In general, the manual grading process can only increase your score, with a
couple of exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You <strong>must not import any Python modules</strong> to use as part of
your solutions -- quizzes with <code>import</code> statements (or their
equivalents!) will be given grades of 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having your code check for a specific input (called "hardcoding")
and then return a specific result is okay only for the base cases in
iteration or recursion.  Problem solutions that look for specific test-case
arguments other than base cases are disallowed and will receive
no credit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if your code passes all the test cases for a particular problem, then
we will not deduct credit from that problem for lack of comments or for
otherwise unoptimal style.  Of course, though, we still encourage commenting as
general good practice, and you may find it helpful for organizing your thought
process; and for problems on which you do <em>not</em> pass all test cases, comments
and general <a href="https://py.mit.edu/fall20/notes/style">good style</a> will help us assign partial
credit.</p>
<p>Note also that to pass some of the tests within the server timeout allotted,
your solution may have to be reasonably efficient.</p>
<p>We will announce when grading and resubmissions have been completed and are
reflected on your Progress Page.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_6"></a><a class="anchor" name="_resubmission"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">6) Resubmission<a class="cs_permalink" href="#_resubmission">§</a></h2>
<p>We offer a resubmission assignment, which allows another attempt at the same
questions on the quiz.  This assignment will become available the morning after
the quiz, and it will close on <strong>Sunday, 18 October at 10pm Eastern</strong>, and late
resubmissions will not be accepted.  This assignment is your chance to revise,
improve, and finish any questions that you are unable to complete during the
quiz.</p>
<p>The resubmission process is an extension of the quiz, so the quiz rules apply
(including the limitation that <strong>your code should be entirely your own work</strong>,
and that <strong>you should not discuss your code with anyone</strong>).</p>
<p>If you resubmit corrected code that <strong>passes all the tests for a particular
question</strong>, then you will earn some additional credit back for that question,
beyond any partial credit you received for your original submission.</p>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_7"></a><a class="anchor" name="_conflicts_and_accommodations"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">7) Conflicts and Accommodations<a class="cs_permalink" href="#_conflicts_and_accommodations">§</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have a conflict such that you are unable to attend the scheduled time, or
if you are in a time zone that makes taking the exam at the scheduled time impractical, please
<a href="https://py.mit.edu/forum/new-message?username=arpl&amp;title=Quiz%201%20Conflict">message Áron via the forum</a> to discuss the possibility of
taking a conflict quiz.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you require accommodations for the quiz (with a note from SDS),
please <a href="https://py.mit.edu/forum/new-message?username=arpl&amp;title=Quiz%201%20Accommodations">message Áron via the forum</a> as well (even if you
have already talked with a staff member), including a copy of your accommodations letter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please contact us by <strong>Saturday, 10 October</strong>, if you have a conflict or require accommodations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="anchor" name="catsoop_section_8"></a><a class="anchor" name="_practice_materials"></a><h2 class="cs_section_title">8) Practice Materials<a class="cs_permalink" href="#_practice_materials">§</a></h2>
<p>Practice materials for the quiz are available below. The following are intended
to be representative of the length and scope of a regular quiz.  As such, we
strongly suggest working through them in an environment that is as authentic as
possible (i.e., with a time limit of 1 hour and 50 minutes).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://py.mit.edu/fall20/quizzes/quiz1/practice/q1_practice_a">Quiz 1 Practice A</a></li>
<li><a href="https://py.mit.edu/fall20/quizzes/quiz1/practice/q1_practice_b">Quiz 1 Practice B</a></li>

<li><a href="https://py.mit.edu/fall20/quizzes/quiz1/practice/q1_practice_d">Quiz 1 Practice D</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, reviewing the materials from lectures, recitations, and previous
labs can be useful practice as well.</p>
<p>Solutions for the practice quizzes are now available <a href="https://py.mit.edu/fall20/quizzes/quiz1/practice/q1_practice_all_solutions.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.  We strongly encourage you not to look at the solutions for a practice quiz until after you have completed that quiz.</p>
